  // The goal is to have the header as tall as the page height so that it looks
  // fullscreen but can then be scrolled past. This falls apart on mobile where
  // the address bar can show or hide depending on how the user is scrolling.
  //
  // By design, the `vh` unit always assumes that the address bar is not there.
  // This is so that the page doesn't start rerendering and convulsing wildly
  // as the user scrolls.
  //
  // One alternative is to use `100%` but that really only works on the `<html>`
  // which in this case would not fly.
  //
  // The compromise here is to take `100vh` but leave some space for the bar.
  // It's not perfect but it's close to the effect I wanted. Also, it's much
  // better at indicating that the page continues and that you can scroll.
