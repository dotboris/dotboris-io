# Stuff I use

For the curious, here's the hardware, software, and gear that I use for work and for fun. It's not an exhaustive list but it covers the stuff that matters to me and that you might like to know about. I try to keep a lot of this as reproducible as possible in my Nix based [config](https://github.com/dotboris/config). This mostly covers software. I don't think that Nix is super accessible for most people but you should be able to read the code and get an idea of how I configure certain things.

## Computers

**Desktop**: This is my primary workstation. I use this to work on personal project, for gaming and to browse the web. I've been upgrading this desktop for years now. I don't remember what it originally was anymore. [Is it even the same computer?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus) Who knows?

The coolest thing I can say about this, is that I've been carrying over the same installation of Arch Linux for years now (I forget how many). It even survived a few disk migrations through the power of [LVM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/LVM).

**Laptop**: This is the computer that I carry around with me. I use it to work on personal projects and to browse the web. While it can do some gaming, I don't use it for that. I originally bought this because I was getting sick of only having my phone as a portable compute device. It was a great decision. If you can afford it, I recommend getting a laptop, it's magical.
