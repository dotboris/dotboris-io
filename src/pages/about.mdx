Hi there, I'm Boris. I'm just a guy going through life doing his own thing.

I'm a big nerd when it comes to technology, especially programming, Linux, and
things like that. I love learning new things, solving problems, building things,
and teaching people. I'm always tinkering with a few projects. You can find out
about what doing these days in my [Now](/now/) page. You can also learn about
all the nerdy stuff I use in my [Uses](/uses/) page.

I value curiosity, kindness, people, and community. Life is a better experience
when you focus on the people around and you make each other happy. To me, the
journey is much better than the destination. It's the friends, experiences, and
memories you've made along the way that matter most. I want to help make the
world a better place. I'm not always sure how I'll go about doing that, but I
want to use my skills as a nerd to help out.

If you'd like to reach out to me, you can contact me via email at
[beraboris@gmail.com](mailto:beraboris+sitecontact@gmail.com). I'd like to ask
you to refrain from any kind of solicitation. I'm not interested in promotions,
jobs, advertisements, or anything like that. I want to hear from real people.

Professionally, I'm a software developer. I've been doing this for quite a few
years now and I think that I can say that I'm quite good at it. These days, I'm
in the dev ops / platform engineering space but I've done all kinds of stuff
like tax / compliance software, CI/CD, websites, and e-commerce. I also like to
dabble in security from time to time. Breaking things is always fun.

I like to give talks from time to time. It's a good way for me to share my ideas
and to teach. Here's the list of talks that I've given in reverse chronological
order:

- January 2026: "Renovate à l'échelle : 400+ dépôts à jour" at Techno Drinks
  Sherbrooke -- Given in French, translates to "Renovate at scale: 400+
  repositories up to date". Based on [Keeping 400+ Repositories up-to-date with
  Renovate](https://source.coveo.com/2025/07/29/keeping-400-plus-repositories-up-to-date-with-renovate/)
  which I wrote for Coveo's technical blog.
- December 2025: "Semantic Reviews: a simple technique for better code reviews."
  at Techno Drinks Sherbrooke -- Given in French. Based on [Semantic Code
  Reviews](https://www.m31coding.com/blog/semantic-reviews.html) by Dr. Kevin
  Schaal. ([english slides](/2025-12-semantic-reviews-slides.pdf))

You can also find some of my stuff elsewhere on the internet:

- July 2025: [Keeping 400+ Repositories up-to-date with
  Renovate](https://source.coveo.com/2025/07/29/keeping-400-plus-repositories-up-to-date-with-renovate/)
  -- An article that I wrote for Coveo's technical blog.

Finally, you can find my technical work on my [GitHub
profile](https://github.com/dotboris). This is mostly personal projects and some
open source contributions.
