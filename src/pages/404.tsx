      <p>That's odd ðŸ¤”. How did you get here?</p>
      <p>
        I don't know what to tell you.  Maybe next time you should try doing
        the exact opposite of whatever it is you did to get here.
      </p>
      <p>
        If that doesn't work, you can always try turning it off and on again.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the meantime, here's a not so helpful link back to
        the <Link to='/'>home page</Link>.
      </p>
    </Layout>
