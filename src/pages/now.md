# What am I up to these days?

I've been working on [`standard-backups`](https://github.com/dotboris/standard-backups/) in my free time. It's a generic backup orchestration solution that's meant to work with any backup tool. I haven't been very satisfied with what's out there so I figured that I'd write my own. Before you ask, yes I've seen [xkcd #927](https://xkcd.com/927/).

It's still pretty early but it's in a working state and I'm already running it on my [home server](https://github.com/dotboris/homelab/blob/main/modules/backups/default.nix). I think I'm getting close to releasing a first v0 for a wider audience. It currently supports basic backup and restore. Also, it only works with [`restic`](https://restic.net/). I want to support more backup tools and I need to write docs and guides so that people other than me can use it.

I've also been working on this website. I recently discovered the indie web and I've been falling in love. It's really great to see people building their own little corners of the internet. This has motivated me to put some more effort into my own website.

I run a [home server](https://github.com/dotboris/homelab) where I host a bunch of services. It's been really fun to see how much I can host myself without relying on cloud-hosted-services that harvest your data. Right now I'm hosting files, contacts, calendars, todos, search, RSS feed aggregation, document archiving, and network-wide ad-blocking. It runs great and is super stable. Next, I want to be able to share this with friends and family.

I'm part of the organizational committee for [Techno Drinks Sherbrooke](https://www.meetup.com/techno-drinks/). It's a monthly meetup in my city about tech stuff. There's usually a couple of talks with some food and drinks. It's a great time. What I really like about it is the community that's growing around it. So far, I've given a few talks which I'm really proud of.

## Old stuff

January 2026: I've been playing [Drova - Forsaken Kin](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1585180/Drova__Forsaken_Kin/) and I've been enjoying it quite a bit. It's a fantastic game. If you like open-world RPGs, give it a try.
