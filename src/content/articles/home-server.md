title: Running your own "Cloud" at home
description: For a while now, I've been tired of having the likes of Google, Microsoft and Facebook in my life. First, they lure you in with free storage and useful apps like office suites, calendars, photos, todos and so on. Then they lock your in their ecosystem, steal your data, serve you ads and exploit you as much as possible.  I built my own server at home to own my data, run these apps myself and take back control of my digital life.

In this article, I'll be showing off the end result of all my work. I won't go into the details of how I implemented this. Instead, I'll focus on the high level pieces and how they fit together. Truth be told, I took the turbo-nerd / very niche approach to building this home server and I don't think that it's appropriate for most folks include the tech savvy ones.

The term "server" might be somewhat confusing or even spooky to some people. Let me reassure you. A server is just a computer. The word "server" is about describing what it does as opposed to what it is. Unlike a normal computer that you use through a mouse, keyboard and screen, a server is a computer that just runs in the background and that you access through web, mobile or desktop apps on another computer, smartphone or tablet.
